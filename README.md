# Fake-_News_Detection
### Introduction:
Because of the simple accessibility and exponential expansion of information available on social media networks, distinguishing between false and real information has become difficult. The ease with which information may be shared has resulted in an exponential increase in the amount of information that can be falsified. Where the transmission of fraudulent material is rampant, the credibility of social media networks is also jeopardised. As a result, automatically verifying the information's source, substance, and publisher in order to categorise it as false or real has become a research problem. Machine learning has played an important role in data classification, but with significant drawbacks. This study examines a number of machine learning algorithms for detecting bogus and counterfeit news. The limitations of such approaches, as well as improvisational methods for applying machine learning and deep learning, are discussed
